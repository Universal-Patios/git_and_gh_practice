One of my favorite travel experiences was when I traveled to Nepal and hiked to Everest base camp. It took 12 days in total to trek there and back. Along the way you stayed in villages and guest houses that have no connection to the rest of the country except for the trail. You spend each day surrounded by beautiful mountain scenery and views. It was one of the most amazing hikes I've done
